    <td>I think that the strategy I used for this lesson was quite effective as this was the first lesson that I actually completed my target. I learnt quite well and I also think that I generally got the idea of developing tables on website. The strategy that was effective for me again was computational thinking.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I think limited my learning was that I didn't listen to the instructions as well as i could have and I didn’t understand parts of the instructions. This meant that is had to ask other people that were in my class which would mean that they would have to stop what they’re doing to help me.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to listen better so that when we get onto more complicated things in out IT lessons I will not have to ask my friends what we are doing because I will already know because I listened better.</td>
