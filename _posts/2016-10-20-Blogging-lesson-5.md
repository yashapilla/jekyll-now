  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I learnt by a mixture of two different strategies. These were both collaboration and computational thinking. I think that the collaborating helped me learn because we were working together and when one person didn't know something the other person probably did know it so this helped us achieve our target a lot quicker.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was the collaboration. I say this because even though this was the most effective method that I used. It meant that I didn’t remember as much things as I could have and I didn’t take away from that lesson as much as I would have if I didn’t collaborate. However, collaboration is still good in certain amounts.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>For next time I will aim to work more independently and not collaborate as much so that I can learn a lot more in the lesson next time.</td>
