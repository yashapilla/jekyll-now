    <td>I leant by using the strategies of trial and error. This was an effective strategy for the task that were set in the lesson as we had to imagine that we were the shopkeeper. This meant that we had to keep on trying new ideas while also collaborating with our peers. This meant that eventually we found the best way to do the task.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was that I got distracted easily. This impeded my learning because I didn't do as much as I could have in the lesson. This meant that I had to do what I didn't do in the lesson homework while also doing my homework.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think for next time I will not look at what others are doing because this will mean that I don't get distracted and will accomplish and complete more work in the lesson.</td>
