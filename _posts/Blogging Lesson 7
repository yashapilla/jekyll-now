    <td>I learnt by listening and making sure that I didnt get distracted by other people. Also I learnt because my blog was being evalutated in the lesson so I found out that I needed to change the colour scheme of my blog as it was terrible. This was very helpful as I got advise from the teachers that only a few other people in the class got.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I was limited in my learning because I didn't actually do anything in the lesson. It was all just listening to Mr Keen and Mr Tansley evaluating some blogs and we didn't actually do the anything to our blogs or our spreadsheets.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think for next time I will not look at what others are doing because this will mean that I don't get distracted and will accomplish and complete more work in the lesson.</td>
