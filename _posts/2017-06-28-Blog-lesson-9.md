  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trial and error. This was quite effective however there are more effective ways that I could use and should apply next time. I also learnt by thinking logically and not just asking the teacher, my friends and google straight away.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that I think that limited my learning was my lack of understanding of python. This is a habit I need to work because if I think more creatively I think that I really will be able to do well/</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will use websites that teach me how to write and learn python code so that I can create a better user interface for my work. Also I will use the technique of computational thinking that we learnt a long time ago to make my work better and work a lot more efficiently than I am working at the current moment. </td>
