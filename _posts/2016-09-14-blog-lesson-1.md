  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trial and error. This was quite effective however there are more effective ways that I could use and should apply next time. I also learnt by thinking logically and not just asking the teacher, my friends and google straight away.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning mainly was my use of trial and error, although using this method you will eventually get to the answer it is very time consuming and not efficient in any way at all. Also another factor that inhibited my learning was that I got distracted quite a few times and this is a habit that i will need to work on in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Firstly I will change the both the strategy and method that is used. Instead of using trial and error I will think more logically and apply computational thinking into my next lesson. Also i will aim to not get as distracted as i did this week as it will affect my learning and i will not get as much out of the lesson that i could have.</td>
