    <td>I learnt by not asking my friends for help and using google. Google is very clever and has all of the answers to my questions and queries.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning in this particular lesson is the fact that I distracted a lot by others asking me questions about their work. Next time I will let them deal with their own problems.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Firstly I will change the both the strategy and method that is used. Instead of using trial and error I will think more logically and apply computational thinking into my next lesson. Also i will aim to not get as distracted as i did this week as it will affect my learning and i will not get as much out of the lesson that i could have.</td>
