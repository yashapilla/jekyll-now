    <td>I think I learnt in this lesson by trial and error but by also not asking for help straight away when I couldn't understand something. I think helped me because I got to understand how to edit my blog a lot more and also Mr Keen didn’t get annoyed by very stupid questions asked by me.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning is that I didn’t listen as well as I could have. This meant that I was slowed down significantly as I didn’t know what to do so i had to figure it out without asking anyone as they would be disrupted from learning about and trying to edit their own blogs they had.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think for next time I will change how much attention I have when the teacher is talking about what we need to learn as this also inhibited my homework as I didn’t know what to do again for it and it took a lot longer that is actually needed.</td>
