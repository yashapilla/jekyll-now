  <tr>
    <td>The way I learnt was by applying parts of computational thinking and this helped me significantly from last week in which is used the strategy of trial and error. I think that this strategy was a lot more efficient than last week and was a lot quicker. This meant i was able to get a lot more done.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was spending to long on the first thing to do, which meant I didn't have enough time to do the second thing which was to change the colour. Also I tried to do something different and got distracted and this broke my website so i had to spend a significant amount of time fixing this and this limited my learning.</td>
